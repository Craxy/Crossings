TODO:
* Fix up rendering so that there's just one big crossing rather than two bendy ones
* Fix UI icon to fit in the circle
* Minimse code copied from game where possible
* Tooltips about build failures

Known Bugs:
* Occasional ArrayIndexOutOfRange exception
* Why the hell are trees appearing on the road occasionally?
* Road flickers on placement
* Crossings show up as able to be placed on the end of corners, but sometimes don't appear until a later update

What works:
* Baisic placement and fuctionality
* Removal with RMB
* Traffic lights on larger roads
* Tool will only appear blue where crossings can be added or removed
