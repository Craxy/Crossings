* Fix up rendering so that there's just one big crossing rather than two bendy ones
* Fix handling on the edge of bend nodes
* Add a way to remove crossings (RMB)
* Fix UI icon to fit in the circle
* Clean up tool code to just use circles rather than beziers (see ToggleTrafficLights tool for example)
* Figure out why the road flickers on placement
* Filter tool to only work on roads (except highways)
* Minimse code copied from game where possible
* Why the hell are trees appearing on the road occasionally?
* Occasional ArrayIndexOutOfRange exception

What works:
* Baisic placement and fuctionality
* Traffic lights on larger roads
