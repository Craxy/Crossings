TODO:
* Fix up rendering on level 3 roads
* Fix UI icon to fit in the circle
* Minimse code copied from game where possible
* Tooltips about build failures
* Stop signposts appearing - it's not really a junction

Known Bugs:
* Occasional ArrayIndexOutOfRange exception (possibly fixed now)
* First placement causes road to flicker
* Crossings show up as able to be placed on the end of corners, but sometimes don't appear until a later update

What works:
* Baisic placement and fuctionality
* Removal with RMB
* Traffic lights on larger roads
* Tool will only appear blue where crossings can be added or removed
