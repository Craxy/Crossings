# Cities: Skylines - Crossing Mod

This mod allows you to places crossings on your roads at locations other than intersections and transitions between road types (where they are automatically placed).

To place a crossing, go to the Roads menu. Underneath the buttons which allow you to select straight, curved etc there should now be a button with a zebra crossing pattern on it. Select this and you will be able to place crossings at most of the same locations where you can currently create an intersection.

To remove a placed crossing, simply right click on it using the same tool.

NOTE: This is very "beta". I've tried to squash all the major bugs, but please don't blame me if it doesn't work properly, corrupts your savegame or sets your computer on fire. However please DO submit a bug report (ideally as an Issue at the github link below) or, better yet a patch.

Known bugs:
* For some reason the first time you place a crossing, the road briefly flickers. Subsequent placements are fine, though.
* The overlay (the blue/red circle showing where you can place crossings) can sometimes render a bit fuzzily around the edges. I've got an idea where to look to fix that one but it's not bad enough to delay the release over.

Future enhancements:
* Add tooltips for when a crossing can't be built
* Stop street signs appearing at crossings
* Highlight buildings which will be destroyed by crossing creation (which can sometimes happen on curved roads because the curvature changes slightly).
